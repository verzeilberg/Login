# Login

##Description
This is a third party login module to create permissions, roles and users to manage the acces to your web app or website.

##How to use

put below code into your .gitmodules file and update your submodules:

[submodule "User"]
    path = module/User
    url = https://github.com/verzeilberg/Login.git
    branch = master
    
At moment of typing there are 2 branches master and xml-user. Xml-user has one extra
permission added to the administrator role.
My advise is to use the master version.
